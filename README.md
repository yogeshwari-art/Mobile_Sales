•	Total Quantity Sold: Aggregate units across 12 months
•	Total Transactions: Total number of sales records
•	Average Unit Price: Mean price per unit
Insight:

2. Regional Performance Insights

•	Mumbai: Secondary market with lower relative volume
Strategic Takeaway:
Resource allocation should favor Delhi. Equal distribution across regions dilutes impact—capital, inventory, and marketing must follow revenue concentration.
